I created this game as a series of assignments for Com S 327 (Advanced Programming Techniques) at Iowa State University. 
Each week, the professor assigned a portion of the project in the form of a pdf document specifying design requirements;
each week building upon code written in previous weeks. After each week's due date, the professor would release a solution 
drop for students to use as they complete the next week's assignment. I took it as a challenge to write the entirety of the 
project myself, building upon my own code rather than the professor's. This resulted in a project unique to me, but with 
some unique design flaws and bugs. While the project isn't perfect, I'm still proud to create a working game, and have taken
it as a learning experience. 

To compile and run my code: 
First, download a zip file of this project from Github, then unzip the file. Use the command line to cd (navigate) to the 
directory and type 'make' to compile. Once the project is built, type './assignment1.09' in order to run the game

To play my game:
I've designed my game to prompt the user for input outside of the main game interface. However, there are some commands which
the user should know before running the game. Use keys: 
'h'- left
'j'- down
'k'- up
'l'- right
