How this was created:
I created this game as a series of assignments for Com S 327 (Advanced Programming Techniques) at Iowa State University. Each week, the 
professor assigned a portion of the project in the form of a pdf document specifying design requirements;each assignment building upon code 
written in previous weeks. After each assignmnet's due date, the professor would release a solution drop for students to use as they 
complete the next week's assignment. I took it as a challenge to write the entirety of the project myself, building upon my own code rather 
than the professor's. This resulted in a project unique to me, but with some unique design characteristics and bugs. While the project 
isn't perfect, I'm still proud to create a mostly reliable game, and have taken this semester as a learning experience. 

To compile and run my code: 
First, download a zip file of this project from Github, then unzip the file. Use the command line to cd to the 
directory and type 'make' to compile. Once the project is built, type './assignment1.09' in order to run the game

To play my game:
Upon compilation, the user is promted to select a starter pokemon. Next, the user is spawned in the center 'map' in the game's 'world'. 
The world consists of over 160,000 maps (401 x 401). The user can freely move between maps, battle other trainers, encounter wild pokemon, 
and enter buildings. I've designed my game to prompt the user for input outside of the main game interface. However, there are some 
commands which the user should know before running the game. Use keys: 
'h'- left
'j'- down
'k'- up
'l'- right 
'y'- up and left (diagonally)
'u'- up and right (diagonally)
'b'- down and left (diagonally)
'n'- down and right (diagonally)
't'- displays a list of all npc trainers on current map
'f'- allows the user to fly to any map (can be turned off at runtime)
'B'- open bag to use healing potion or revive

How the game works (FOR NERDS):
Before the player is prompted to choose a starter pokemon, the game allocates memory for all 160,000+ maps, then
